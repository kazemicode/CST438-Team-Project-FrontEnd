# CST 438 Team Project

## Objectives:
### Practice Agile team procedures of iterative development: 
* Three weekly sprints
* Pair programming 
* Code reviews (via pull requests) 
* Utilize a version control system (Git/GitHub)
* Track and prioritize requirements with [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2440442) 
* JUnit test cases using MOCKS

### Use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design to implement two back end microservices and a front end
* The front end can be a mobile app using Android emulator and using REST to communicate with services
* The front end can be html-JavaScript web pages
* The front end will use REST to communication with back end services
* Microservices should use either asynchronous communication (RabbitMQ message queues) or synchronous (HTTP) to communicate with each other
